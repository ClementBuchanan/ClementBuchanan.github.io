# Diversity and Inclusion

The number of women in tech began to decline in the 7o's and this due partly to the culrural revolution of personal computers and the sef-subscribed belief that computers were for boys. Boys were given computers as toys which gave them the advantage of familiarity over girls when they became adults.

According to Diversity in Tech an employee breakdown in tech revealed that in 2017 the top five companies with a diverse tech workforce were:

1. Indiegogo - Had a 5% increase in female tech workers
1. Pandora - 0% increase over the previous year
1. Pinterest - Had a 5% increase in female tech workers
1. Google - Had a 3% increase in female tech workers
1. Linkedin - 0% increase over the previous year

## Why should all this matter?

It matters because diverse teams are smarter and more creative. Think of it this way, imagine how much more you can get from a team of people with different ideas, thoughts, productivity and creativity when they bring different life experiences to the job. A lot more. "Diverse groups of people bring to organizations more and different ways of seeing a problem and, thus, faster/better ways of solving it."

Diverse companies perform better. Given that diverse teams are smarter and more creative than homogeneous ones, this often shows a strong correlation between diverse organizations and positive financial outcomes.

To be diverse is just the right thing to do. What does it mean to be diverse? One example is when the employees of an organization better represent their users and desired users, they will build products more effectively for those groups. When YouTubeâ€™s almost entirely right-handed developer team built the iOS app without considering how left-handed people would use it, for example, 5% to 10% of videos were uploaded upside down as a result.
