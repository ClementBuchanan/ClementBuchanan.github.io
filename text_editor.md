### What is a WYSIWYG text editor?
In computing, a WYSIWYG editor is a system in which content (text and graphics) can be edited in a form closely resembling its appearance when printed or displayed as a finished product, such as a printed document, web page, or slide presentation. 

##### Different classifications of text editors
There are quite a few of them but the best ones I've used is the JCE Editor for building Joomla websites and ofcourse there's the editor used in MS Word when writing documents.

Here's a list of a some others:

1. **Xinha** - Xinha is a new and powerful WYSIWYG editor for Joomla platform. It is translated into over 30 languages and also has lot of handy plugins. After installing, you can enable the plugin from the plugin settings.

### Why it’s important for software developers to be thoughtful about their selection of what they use to write code.
It is import to chose the the right WYSIWYG editor for the environment you're working in. For example when building Joomla websites I prefer to use the JCE Editor to write articles because of its ease of use, flexibility and it is rich with features. When writing documents I like to use MS Word for the same reasons. Although Notepad is a text editor I don't like to use. I just don't. Some WYSIWYG editors are built into software packages and others are plugins. There are also some case where you can't use a WYSIWYG editor. 
 
### Why use the terminal

- **Using the Command Line** - To utomate tasks via scripts and batch files, perform advanced administrative functions, and troubleshoot or solve issues.
- **For Basic Navigation** -  One way to give yourself a sense of orientation when using the command prompt, is being able to navigate around the file system and into different folders.
- **About Files** - Command prompt can search a particular drive, or a specific folder for files and folders.
