# Reflections and Discussions of My First Day of Training at Code Fellows

It was a rainy day in Seattle, November 9th to be exact. I started my coding training program at Code Fellows. The day pretty much started off without a hitch. There are thirteen students in this cohort and in a nut shell we started with the follows. This is an example of an orderer list using markdown language.

1. Introducing ourselves to each other
1. Overview of the Canvas LMS platform
1. Explanation and setup of online tools such as Github, Zoom, and Slack

The actual work started off by using markdown language to create github page. This is an examplle of an unordered list using markdown language:

- Growth Mindset
- Markdown on GitHub
- Getting Started with GitHub Pages

The syntax (format) for writing in Markdown language is like this:

Example: Header 1 is characterized by having 1 hashtag before the words
# Hello World!

Example: Header 2 is characterized by having 2 hashtags before the words
## Whazzaap!

Example Header 3 is characterized by having 3 hashtags before the words
### Nada Mas!

Example Header 4 is characterized by having 4 hashtags before the words
### Ouch. That hurts!

Example Header 5 is characterized by having 5 hashtags before the words
### There's no crying in baseball.

Example Header 6 is characterized by having 6 hashtags before the words
### Peace be with you until the end of days my friend.

The day went well until it was time to setup my computer. This was a bit challenging due to my Windows computer not being able to update which is a big problem. I'm waiting for my Macbook Pro to arrive. Until then I'm not sure what will happen. 

My instructor keeps saying, *__"hit the pause button"__.* (This is how to write text in bolded italics).

What he means is to never give up. Do not get frustrated. If you tried and failed, you should step back for the work, reflect, come back and try it again. 

There is a lot more that happened that I'd like to share with you but I can't share them right now. I can only say I hope you can learn how to do it too.
