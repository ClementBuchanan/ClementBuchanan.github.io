It was a rainy day in Seattle, November 9th to be exact. I started my coding training program at Code Fellows. The day pretty much started off without a hitch. There are thirteen students in this cohort and in a nut shell we started with the follows. This is an example of an orderer list using markdown language.

1. Introducing ourselves to each other
1. Overview of the Canvas LMS platform
1. Explanation and setup of online tools such as Github, Zoom, and Slack

The actual work started off by using markdown language to create github page. This is an examplle of an unordered list using markdown language:

- Growth Mindset
- Markdown on GitHub
- Getting Started with GitHub Pages

The syntax (format) for writing in Markdown language is like this:

- Header 1: Characterized by having 1 hashtag before the words, ex. # Hello World!
- Header 2: Characterized by having 2 hashtags before the words, ex. ## Whazzaap!
- Header 3: Characterized by having 3 hashtags before the words, ex. ### Nada Mas!

The day went well until it was time to setup my computer. This was a bit challenging due to my Windows computer not being able to update which is a big problem. I'm waiting for my Macbook Pro to arrive. Until then I'm not sure what will happen.
