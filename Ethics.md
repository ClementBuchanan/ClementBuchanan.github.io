## A reflection on ethics in technology and the workplace.

The technology industry is no different than any other. There SHOULD be a code of ethics and code of conduct that organizations and their employees must adhere to. For the good and protection of the community at large there must be accoutability for misdeeds and wrong doings. Although they do exist people often do break the rules sometimes with impunity and are often allowed to continue doing so. Take the pharmacuetical industry as an example. For many years they were allowed to continue making opiods although it was proven that it is not safe and causes harm to people. Therefore, while many organizations like Microsoft, Google Amazon have implemented some checks and balances in their programming and services offered to the public they still prescribed to external governing communities. I applaud them for that.

A review of articles both “Ethics in the workplace” and “Ethics in Technology” have shown the importance of ethics in technology. I do  agree with them articles both. Engineers should not be forced or coerced into using their creative skills for doing uncooth activities that will ultomately cause harm to people. Organizations should be held accountable for wjen their products or services misleads or cause harm to people. These are the things that stuckout most to me.
