# A summary of lesson 3

## Chapter 4 is about website links and how they are created.

Links are created using <> with an 'a' element between them indicating an attribute called href. The value of an href attribute is the page you want users to go to when they click the link. It is written like this:

< a href="https://www.livewisely2020.com">

So you can link to anything on the internet with this.

  * To external websites
  * To other ages on the current website
  * To images and videos, etc.

Links are often seen with underlines on them. When you're linking a page on  the current website you do not need to use the url (https//: www.livewisely2020.com). Instead you will use a relative url:

  * Same folder
  * child folder
  * parent folder
  * Grandparent folder, etc.

## Chapter 15 is about website layout talks about how to control where each element sits on a webpage and how to create attractive webpage layouts.

  * It discusses different waays to position elements using normal flow.
  * It discusses how different devices (phones, computers, ipad) or any electronic device with a screen and have access to the internet will render the website.
  * How to create fixed width and liquid layouts.

  Key concepts of laying out webpages include:

  * Positioning of elements: building blocks, containing elements, 
  * controlling element positions: normal flow, relative positioning fixed positioning, floating elements.
