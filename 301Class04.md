# CSS Grids

CSS Grid Layout is the best layout system available in CSS. It's 2 dimensional systeM that can handle both columns and rows, unlike flexbox which is mainly a 1 dimensional system. You work with Grid Layout by applying CSS rules both to a parent element (which becomes the Grid Container) and to that elementâ€™s children (which become Grid Items).

To start using CSS grids you have to do the following:

1. Define a container element as a grid with __display: grid__
1. Set the column and row sizes with __grid-template-columns__ and __grid-template-rows__
1. Place its child elements into the grid with __Grid-column__ and __grid-row.__

EXAMPLE:

.grid {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(200px, 1fr));
  grid-gap: 1rem;
}

#### Grid parent properties

Display: defines the element as a grid container. Its values are:

1. grid - generates a block level grid
1. inline-grid - generates an inline level grid

Grid-Template-columns and Grid-Template-Rows: Defines the columns and rows of the grid with a space separated list of values like this:

.container {
  grid-template-columns: 40px 50px auto 50px 40px;
  grid-template-rows: 25% 100px auto;
}

# What is Regex?

Regular expressions (Regex or Regexp) are patterns used to match character combinations in strings.  Regular expressions are also objects in JavaScript. The patterns are used with the exec() and test() methods of RegExp, and with the match(), matchAll(), replace(), replaceAll(), search(), and split() methods of String.

Two ways of creating them:

1. Use a regex literal consisting of a pattern enclosed between slashes: **_let re = /a+b+c/;_**
1. Calling the constructor function of the RegExp object: *_let re = new RegExp ('a+b+c');

In JavaScript regular expressions are used with the RegExp methods:

1. test()- Executes a search for a match in a string. It returns an array of information or null on a mismatch
1. exec() - Tests for a match in a string. It returns true or false
  
With the String methods:

1. match() - Returns an array containing all of the matches, including capturing groups, or null if no match is found.
1. match all () - Returns an iterator containing all of the matches, including capturing groups.
1. replace() Executes a search for a match in a string, and replaces the matched substring with a replacement substring.
1. search() - Tests for a match in a string. It returns the index of the match, or -1 if the search fails.
1. split() - Uses a regular expression or a fixed string to break a string into an array of substrings.
