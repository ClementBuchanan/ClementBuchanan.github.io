# What is Node?

In IT term a node is a device or data point in a larger network. In networking a node is either a connection point, a redistribution point, or a communication endpoint. In computer science, nodes are devices or data points on a large network, devices such a PC, phone, or printer are considers nodes. In terms of software development. A node can be many things :

1. A server in a cluster is often termed a node
1. A point in a ‘graph’ were edges meet is often called a node.
1. A data structure in a binary tree where data is stored are either called leaf or branch nodes - but then binary trees are just particular types of graph.

According to Mark Williams, PhD Computer Science & Electrical Engineering from the University of Chicago (1986), a node is a basic unit of a data structure, such as a linked list or tree data structure. Nodes contain data and also may link to other nodes. Links between nodes are often implemented by pointers.

I programming Node.js is a platform built on Chrome's JavaScript runtime for easily building fast and scalable network applications. It uses an event-driven  model that makes it lightweight and efficient, perfect for data-intensive real-time applications that run across distributed devices or nodes.

# What are API's?

API is the acronym for Application Programming Interface, which is a software intermediary that allows two applications to talk to each other. For example:

1. When you use an application on your mobile phone, the application connects to the Internet and sends data to a server
1. The server then retrieves that data, interprets it, performs the necessary actions and sends it back to your phone.
1. The application then interprets that data and presents you with the information you wanted in a readable way. 

This is what an API is - all of this happens via API.
