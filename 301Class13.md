# How Forms Data is Transmitted

Once a form data has been validated on the client-side, the form is ready to be transmitted. We will now discuss what happens when a user submits a form — where does the data go, and how do we handle it when it gets there? We also look at some of the security concerns associated with sending form data.

**An example of a simple client/server architecture**

At it most basic, a client server setup includes a client (usually a web browser) that sends a request to a server (most of the time a web server like Apache, Nginx, IIS, Tomcat, etc.), using the HTTP protocol. The server answers the request using the same protocol.

## On the client side - How the datat is sent

The <form> element defines how the data will be sent. All of its attributes are designed to let you configure the request to be sent when a user hits a submit button. The two most important attributes are:

1. **action** - Defines where the data gets sent. If this attribute isn't provided, the data will be sent to the URL of the page containing the form — the current page.
1. **method** - Defines how data is sent. The HTTP protocol provides several ways to perform a request; HTML form data can be transmitted via a number of different methods, the most common being the GET method and the POST method.

## On the server sid - How the data is recieved

Whichever HTTP method you choose, the server receives a string that will be parsed in order to get the data as a list of key/value pairs. The way you access this list depends on the development platform you use and on any specific frameworks you may be using with it.
