# What is database normalization?

It is the process of organizing a db into talbes and columns to minimize data duplication, to minimize or avoid data midification issues and to simplify queries. 

Databases can have anomalies and data modification can fix them. there are three types:

1. **Insert anomaly** - a row must be fully completed.
1. **Update anomaly** - when information changes all appropriate details must be updated otherwise inconsistencies will appear.
1. **Deletion anomaly** - deletion of a row causes the removal of more than one set of facts.

### The concept normal form

Informally, a relational database relation is often described as "normalized" if it meets third normal form. Most 3NF relations are free of insertion, update, and deletion anomalies.

The normal forms (from least normalized to most normalized) are:

1. UNF: Unnormalized form
1. 1NF: First normal form
1. 2NF: Second normal form
1. 3NF: Third normal form
1. EKNF: Elementary key normal form
1. BCNF: Boyceâ€“Codd normal form
1. 4NF: Fourth normal form
1. ETNF: Essential tuple normal form
1. 5NF: Fifth normal form
1. DKNF: Domain-key normal form
1. 6NF: Sixth normal form

Adatsbases should be carefully designed as there are benefits to why we should do this process. It reduces redundancy, increases data integrity and improves performance.
