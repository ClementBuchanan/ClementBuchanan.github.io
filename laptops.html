                <p><h3>My favorite type of computer is a Mac.</h3>
                    <p>It is an electronic device that manipulates information, or data. It has the ability to store, retrieve, and process data.</hp>
                    <li>My first computer was a Windows computer</li>
                    <li>My second computer was a Mac</li>
                    <li>I prer to use Mac computers than Windows computers because the are so much better.</li>
                </p>
                <p><H3>Binary & Data</H3>
                    <li>Binary data is data whose unit can take on only two possible states, traditionally labeled as 0 and 1.</li>
                    <li>Computers use binary - the digits 0 and 1 - to store data.</li>
                    <li>A transistor is a tiny switch that is activated by the electronic signals it receives. The digits 1 and 0 used in binary reflect the on and off states of a transistor</li>
                </P>
                <p><h3>Circuits and Logic</h3>
                    <p>Computers often chain logic gates together, by taking the output from one gate and using it as the input to another gate.</p>
                    <li>Ths is called a circuit logic</li>
                    <li>Circuits enables computers to do more complex operations than they could with just one gate</li>
                    <li>It has one or more binary inputs. </li>
                </p>
