# Have you ever thought to yourself, "Why is it so hard for me to learn anything, and how can I fix it?"

First you must understand your learning mindset and know the differences between them. There are several types of learning mindsets but I will talk about the **Growth Mindset** and the **Fixed Mindset**. Having either of these will determine how you will learn anything. Let me explain and characterize them for you.



## Growth Mindset ##
A person with a growth mindset often sees the glass is half-full and wants to fill it back up by any means necessary. These individuals are highly motivated.

1. The main thing for this individual is to show the fdifferent ways the glass can be refilled.
1. This mindset is synonomous with making achievements.
1. People with growth mindsets seeks help when studying.
1. They have a positive response to challenges and setbacks.
1. Learning is most important for this person.
1. Values effort: Yes

## Fixed Mindset ##
A person having a fixed mindset often sees the glass as being half empty and there's only one way to refill it.

- The main thing for this person is to show that the glass can be refilled.
- Looking smart is more important for this person
- Values effort: No

## How do I remind myself to stay in a growth mindset? ##

- I create a daily to do list, print it out and stick it to a wall in my workspace.
- When I get stuck or if I feel like my creative juices are no longer flowing I physically step away from what I'm doing. Physically I'm not there but mentally I am, that way as my mojo returns I'm not too far removed from where I left off.
- Being an avid learner also keeps me in the Growth Mindset. As a Software Developer in training I am well aware that I am required to constantly be in my training zone/frame of mind, therefore I have created a repository of resources such as youtube videos and coding website links that I can rely on to help me when I need them.
