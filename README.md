# How not to make your inability to learn things drive you crazy.
Have you ever thought to yourself, "Why is it so hard for me to learn anything, and how can I fix it?"
First you must understand your learning mindset and know the difference between them. Their are several types of learning mindsets but I will talk about the **Growth Mindset** and the **Fixed Mindset**. Having either of these will determine you ability to learn anything. Let me explain and characterize them for you.

## Growth Mindset
A person with a growth mindset always sees the glass is half full and wants to fill it back up.
- This is synonomous with making achievements
- 

## Fixed Mindset ##
A person having a fixed mindset is the polar opposite. He/She always sees the glass as being half empty and wants to leave it that way.
