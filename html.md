# This is a summary of what HTML is and how is it used to create websites

HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language and are used to write webpages that are text documents. It uses tags to give information between them meaning. Here's an example of a pair of tags with information between them. 

The first pair is called an open tag and the second pair is called a closed tag. To learn HTML you must know what tags are available for you to use, what they do and where they go.
