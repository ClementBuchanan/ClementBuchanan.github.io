## What is it?

Git is one of the most utilized Version Control Systems in the world. It can support large projects, prevents corruption, and has a simple design. 

**Workflow**

The local repository structure has three structures:

1. Working Directory: This is where the actual files resides.
1. Index: This is the area used for staging.
1. Head: this points to the most recent commit (Saved).

**Uses**

It is used for importing an existing project or directory onto a local terminal for editing. After editing completion files and folders can be cloned in Git. Other things you can do with it:

1. You can use it to check on the status of a file: To do this we use the command - *__$ git status__*
1. It can be used for tracking and staging files: To do this we use the commands - *__git add filename__* (for single file) and *__$ Git add *__* (for multiple files)
1. After staging files they are completed they should be committed to record what was done in them: This is done by using the command: *__$ Git commit -m "made changes to x, y z and all"__*
1. Finally 'Pushing' refers to pushing the changed file or folder or project up to the remote reposiitory in the cloud: This is done using the command: *__$ Git push origin main__*
